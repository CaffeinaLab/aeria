# Aeria v3

Aeria is a lightweight, fast and modular WordPress development kit. 

It offers a modern interface from within WordPress giving content managers and editors the potential to customise the website with all kinds of components. 

> We spent a huge amount of time with the UX team to design a user interface that would be the most user friendly and simple so that it was easy for anyone to add and edit custom content. 

### Development

Developing with Aeria is so easy. Through simple and intuitive JSON configuration files, you can define all your post types and any of the components defined below. We chose the configuration through file because this way it can be versioned and remains in the repository.

Steps to use it

1. Download and install the plugin to your WordPress website.
2. Enable the plugin from the WP dashboard.
3. Start writing your post type definitions.
4. Get to the dashboard and experience the modern UI.
5. Start adding your custom content to your website.


### Updates

It is possible to update Aeria through WordPress as any other WordPress plugin.
